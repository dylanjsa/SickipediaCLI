SickipediaCLI
==============

This is a seriously simple 'ncurses' based objective-c command-line interface to www.sickipedia.org.
It provides an Xcode project, and a silly little make file. The only reason I made this is because I'm trying to revert to using command-line utils as much as possible.

Building
------------

You can build the project and edit the code with XCode - however ncurses doesn't run in the console window on Xcode - you need to do this with Terminal.app.
You can use the makefile for this.

### Makefile
- clean : Clean all build output.
- compile : Build the project.
- run : Run the built project.

Compile depends on clean, run depends on compile.
So you can just do a 'make run', to do everything. If there is something you want to add - feel free to do so.
